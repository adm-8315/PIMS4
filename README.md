# PIMS4 Modernization

This repository contains the modernization effort of the PIMS4 (Production & Inventory Management System) application. We are transitioning from a legacy PHP application to a modern architecture while maintaining business continuity.

## Current Status
- Analyzing existing codebase
- Planning modernization strategy
- Setting up development infrastructure

## Technology Decisions
- **Framework**: Symfony components for modular migration
- **Infrastructure**: Docker-based with Nginx, PHP-FPM, MariaDB
- **Development**: Modern PHP practices with strong typing

## Documentation
All project documentation is maintained in the `/docs` directory:
- Architecture decisions
- Development guides
- Deployment procedures
- Migration strategies

## Getting Started
See [Development Setup](docs/development/setup.md) for local development instructions.

## Contributing
Documentation and development guidelines are being established. Check the `/docs` directory for updates.
