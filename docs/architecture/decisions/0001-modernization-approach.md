# 1. Modernization Approach

## Status
Proposed

## Context
PIMS4 is a legacy PHP application that needs modernization while maintaining business continuity. Key considerations:
- Current system uses deprecated mysql_* functions
- Monolithic PHP application structure
- Basic Docker setup exists
- Need for team collaboration
- Business operations cannot be disrupted

## Decision
We will:
1. Use Symfony components for gradual modernization
2. Enhance Docker infrastructure with:
   - Nginx + PHP-FPM replacing Apache
   - Redis for caching
   - RabbitMQ for message queue
3. Implement modern development practices:
   - Git workflow
   - Documentation standards
   - Testing infrastructure

## Rationale
- Symfony components allow modular adoption
- Modern infrastructure improves performance
- Gradual approach maintains stability
- Enhanced documentation supports team collaboration

## Consequences
### Positive
- Can modernize incrementally
- Better performance and maintainability
- Improved development workflow
- Enhanced security

### Negative
- Initial setup complexity
- Learning curve for team
- Temporary maintenance overhead

## Implementation Plan
1. Document existing functionality
2. Setup enhanced Docker environment
3. Begin database layer modernization
4. Gradually replace legacy code
